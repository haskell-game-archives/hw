My take on a real time strategy game based on the "Homeworld" game series, hence
the name, which is a working title fo now.

## Disclaimer

This game is not a game yet and things will change a lot.

## Dependencies

you will need some unstable libraries in your sandbox:

* [affection (3d branch)](https://github.com/nek0/affection/tree/3d)
* [gegl](https://github.com/nek0/gegl)
* [babl](https://github.com/nek0/babl)

all other dependencies should be installable through cabal.
